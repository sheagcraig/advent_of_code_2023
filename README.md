# AoC 2023
Here you'll find my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenge.

I managed to solve all of the day 1 problems on my own, and a majority of the day 2 problems, all
while learning Rust. This was my first Advent of Code, and so there were a lot of surprises like
needing to carefully inspect the input for magical solutions that more experienced people
anticipated. I had to lean on their expertise for some of the more intense part 2s, especially as
they dipped into linear algebra.

Because I had a lot of holiday stuff going on beyond just restoring snow operations for Santa and
the elves, there's not a lot of documentation about how the solutions actually work. For a really
great way to learn all about these solutions, please check out https://github.com/derailed-dash/Advent-of-Code
